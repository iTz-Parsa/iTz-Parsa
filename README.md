## About Me

a 16-year-old aspiring cybersecurity professional.
I've been passionate about technology since a young age. My interest in penetration testing and vulnerability research has led me to explore the exciting world of cybersecurity. I'm currently diving deep into OWASP and Bug Bounty programs to enhance my skills and knowledge. 
Besides security, I enjoy programming and am always eager to learn new languages and frameworks. Linux is my go-to operating system, and I'm constantly tinkering with it.
