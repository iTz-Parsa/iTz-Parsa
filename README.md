## About Me

I'm a 17-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast and programmer with a strong passion for technology. From a young age, I've been deeply interested in understanding how systems work and how to secure them. My primary focus lies in the field of cybersecurity, where I actively explore penetration testing, vulnerability research, and Bug Bounty programs. I'm also dedicated to expanding my expertise through continuous learning, particularly in areas such as OWASP methodologies and modern security practices. In addition to cybersecurity, I enjoy programming and experimenting with new languages and frameworks. Linux is my preferred operating system, and I constantly explore its inner workings to enhance my technical proficiency.
